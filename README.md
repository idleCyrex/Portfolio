# Portfolio
Welcome to my Portfolio! This repository showcases my personal and professional projects, built
primarily with React and Express.js.

## About
This project is a full-stack personal portfolio website designed to highlight my skills, experience, and
work. It features a modern React frontend with a responsive, user-friendly interface. The backend is
powered by Express.js and is responsible for handling contact form submissions securely.
For email functionality, the site integrates with Resend a modern email service to process and send
contact form messages directly to my inbox. This ensures reliable email delivery and adds an extra
layer of professionalism to the sites communication features.

## Features
- Fully responsive design
